# SMS-Spam-Classifier
# Overview
In today's digital era, mobile communication through SMS has become an integral part of daily life. However, the increase in SMS usage has also led to a rise in spam messages, which can be annoying and potentially harmful. An SMS Spam Classifier aims to automatically identify and filter out spam messages from legitimate ones, enhancing user experience and security.
# Problem Statement
Spam messages constitute a significant portion of SMS traffic, leading to wasted time, potential security risks, and general user dissatisfaction. Traditional methods of filtering spam, such as manual reporting or simple keyword matching, are often inadequate. There is a need for an automated, intelligent system that can accurately classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam using advanced machine learning and NLP techniques.
# Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate SMS Spam Classifier that can distinguish between spam and legitimate messages. The system will leverage machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to analyze and classify SMS text data effectively.
# Scope
<b>Data Collection:</b> Acquire a dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham (non-spam) from publicly available sources or through data collection mechanisms.<br>
<b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Clean and preprocess the SMS text data to remove noise, handle missing values, and normalize text (e.g., lowercasing, removing punctuation).<br>
<b>Feature Extraction:</b> Extract relevant features from the text using techniques such as tokenization, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and word embeddings.<br>
<b>Model Development:</b> Develop and train various machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).<br>
<b>Model Evaluation:</b> Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.<br>
<b>Implementation:</b> Implement the best-performing model in a user-friendly application that can classify incoming SMS messages in real-time.<br>
<b>Deployment:</b> Deploy the application in a scalable environment, such as a cloud platform, to handle real-world SMS traffic.<br>
# Challenges
<b>Data Quality:</b> Ensuring the dataset is comprehensive and representative of real-world SMS traffic, including diverse spam and ham messages.<br>
<b>Text Normalization:</b> Handling variations in SMS language, such as abbreviations, slang, and emoticons.<br>
<b>Feature Selection:</b> Identifying the most relevant features that contribute to accurate spam classification.<br>
<b>False Positives/Negatives:</b> Balancing the trade-off between false positives (classifying legitimate messages as spam) and false negatives (failing to identify spam messages).<br>
